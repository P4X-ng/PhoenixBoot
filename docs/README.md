[![QEMU Boot Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/qemu--boot-validated-blue)](#qemu-boot-validation)
[![Production Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/production-ready-success)](#production-first-architecture)

## 🚀 Production-First Quick Start

**PhoenixGuard has been completely reorganized** around a production-first architecture with strict separation between production code and development/demo content.

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Bootstrap toolchain and validate environment
just setup

# Build production artifacts from staging/ sources only
just build

# Create bootable EFI System Partition image
just package-esp

# Execute full QEMU boot validation with OVMF firmware
just qemu-test

# Run complete production test suite
just test

# Progressive recovery (safe defaults)
just nuke progressive
```

See docs/PROGRESSIVE_RECOVERY.md for the recovery ladder, safety gates, and rollback steps.

### 🏗️ Production Directory Structure
```
PhoenixGuard/
├── 🎯 staging/          # Production-ready code (ONLY source for builds)
│   ├── src/            # Core UEFI applications (NuclearBootEdk2, KeyEnrollEdk2)
│   ├── boot/           # Compiled EFI binaries
│   ├── tools/          # Production build scripts
│   └── include/        # Production headers
├── 🔧 dev/             # Hardware development (isolated from production)
├── 🚧 wip/             # Work-in-progress (excluded from builds)
├── 🎭 demo/            # Demonstration content (completely quarantined)
├── 📦 out/             # Build artifacts (strict staging/ sourcing)
└── 📋 Justfile         # Production orchestrator (replaces Makefiles)
```

### 🛡️ Zero-Contamination Policy
**Production builds cannot access demo, wip, or dev content.** The build system validates this constraint and fails if any external dependencies are detected.

### 🖥️ Real QEMU Boot Validation
The `just qemu-test` target performs actual UEFI boot testing:
- **OVMF firmware** - Real UEFI environment
- **Production ESP image** - Bootable FAT32 with BootX64.efi
- **Serial capture** - Complete boot sequence logging
- **Success validation** - PhoenixGuard execution markers
- **JUnit reports** - CI-compatible test results

## Quickstart: Hardware-Level Firmware Recovery

### 🛠️ **Hardware Firmware Recovery**

PhoenixGuard includes a hardware-level firmware recovery system that can detect and bypass bootkit protections, extract SPI flash firmware, and perform clean firmware replacement.

**Hardware Recovery Capabilities:**
- **SPI Flash Extraction**: Direct hardware-level firmware dumps using flashrom
- **Bootkit Protection Bypass**: Automatic detection and bypass of hardware write locks
- **Baseline Verification**: Compare firmware against known-good signature database
- **Secure Backup & Restore**: Create verified backups and restoration workflows
- **Integration with VM Remediation**: Automated firmware checks from dom0 VMs

**Quick Commands:**
```bash
# Verify firmware integrity (safe, no writes)
sudo python3 scripts/hardware_firmware_recovery.py --verify-only /dev/null

# Extract current firmware to timestamped file
sudo python3 scripts/hardware_firmware_recovery.py --verify-only /dev/null
# Then manually run dump_flash() method

# Full recovery with clean firmware image
sudo python3 scripts/hardware_firmware_recovery.py clean_firmware.bin
```

**Integrated VM Recovery:**
- **KVM Snapshot Jump**: Boot clean snapshot with GPU passthrough and enhanced CPU features
- **Dom0 Firmware Audits**: Automatic firmware verification from Xen dom0 VMs
- **Host-to-VM Communication**: SSH-based firmware recovery coordination

### 🔐 **Clean GRUB Boot & Xen Snapshot Jump**

You can chainload a known-clean GRUB from NuclearBoot as an alternative to the Xen jump. This is useful when you want a simple, non‑hypervisor path while still avoiding a potentially compromised on‑disk bootloader.

**Install (on a running Linux with the ESP mounted at /boot/efi):**
- Stage clean GRUB/shim and a minimal grub.cfg on the ESP, substituting your root UUID:
  ```bash
  sudo ./scripts/install_clean_grub_boot.sh \
    --esp /boot/efi \
    --root-uuid <ROOT_UUID> \
    [--shim /usr/lib/shim/shimx64.efi.signed] \
    [--grub-efi /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/grubx64.efi] \
    [--vmlinuz /boot/vmlinuz-<ver>] [--initrd /boot/initrd.img-<ver>]
  ```

**Use at boot:**
- In NuclearBoot menu, press **G** for "Clean GRUB Boot". It tries \\EFI\\PhoenixGuard\\shimx64.efi, then \\EFI\\PhoenixGuard\\grubx64.efi.
- Press **K** for "KVM Snapshot Jump" to boot your clean VM snapshot with GPU passthrough.
- Press **X** for "Xen Snapshot Jump" to boot into Xen hypervisor for remediation.

**Validate after boot to detect partition switching:**
- `sudo EXPECT_UUID=<ROOT_UUID> resources/xen/dom0/validate-clean-os.sh`

**Notes:**
- Secure Boot: prefer shimx64.efi.signed and ensure grubx64.efi is trusted (MOK/vendor key).
- The provided grub.cfg pins the root by UUID to avoid "hd" reordering tricks.
- KVM snapshots use enhanced CPU passthrough with host CPU features and topology detection.
- All VM solutions use Secure Boot enabled OVMF with Microsoft key templates.

For the Xen-based remediation path and passthrough setup, see resources/xen/README.md.

**"Like the mythical phoenix, your system rises from the ashes of compromise"**

## Philosophy: Embrace the Breach

PhoenixGuard implements a revolutionary approach to firmware security:

> **"It's OK to get infected as long as the next boot is clean"**

Instead of trying to prevent every possible attack (which is impossible), PhoenixGuard assumes that compromise will happen and focuses on **automatic recovery and resilience**.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Assume Breach** 
Accept that sophisticated attackers will eventually compromise your firmware. Design for recovery, not prevention.

### 2. **Break the Persistence Chain**
Even if malware infects firmware, prevent it from establishing long-term persistence by ensuring clean boots.

### 3. **Automatic Recovery**
No manual intervention required - the system heals itself automatically when compromise is detected.

### 4. **Multiple Recovery Vectors**
Provide multiple independent recovery paths so attackers cannot block all of them.

### 5. **Clean OS Priority**
As long as the OS is clean, firmware compromise becomes irrelevant for most attack scenarios.

## Clean OS Boot Recovery

### The Ultimate Persistence Breaker

PhoenixGuard's **Clean OS Boot Recovery** implements the philosophy that firmware compromise doesn't matter if you always boot a clean OS:

```
TRADITIONAL APPROACH:        PHOENIXGUARD APPROACH:
┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│   Prevent Infection │     │   Embrace Infection │
│         ↓           │     │         ↓           │
│   ❌ Often Fails    │     │   🔄 Always Recover │
│         ↓           │     │         ↓           │
│   System Halts     │     │   Clean OS Boots    │
│   (Availability ↓)  │     │   (Availability ↑)  │
└─────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
```

### Clean OS Sources

#### 🌐 **Network PXE Boot**
```yaml
Source: Network PXE Server
Priority: 100 (Highest)
Description: Boot clean Ubuntu from trusted network server
Configuration:
  Server: 192.168.1.100
  Kernel: /clean-images/vmlinuz-5.15.0-clean
  Initrd: /clean-images/initrd-clean.img
  Protocol: TFTP (port 69) or HTTPS (port 443)
```

#### 💿 **Read-Only Media Boot**
```yaml
Source: CD/DVD/Write-Protected USB
Priority: 90
Description: Boot from write-protected media
Configuration:
  Device: \EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI
  Image: \LIVE\CLEAN_UBUNTU_22.04.ISO
  Verification: SHA-256 hash + write-protection check
```

#### 🔐 **Cryptographically Signed Images**
```yaml
Source: Signed OS Image
Priority: 80
Description: Boot from digitally signed OS image
Configuration:
  Image: \CLEAN\SIGNED_UBUNTU.IMG

## Integration with RFKilla

PhoenixGuard replaces the traditional "halt on compromise" approach in RFKilla:

### Before (Traditional):
```c
if (MicrocodeCompromised || ThermalTampering || BootkitDetected) {
    DEBUG((DEBUG_ERROR, "CRITICAL COMPROMISE DETECTED!"));
    CpuDeadLoop();  // 💀 System halts - availability lost
}
```

### After (PhoenixGuard):
```c
if (MicrocodeCompromised || ThermalTampering || BootkitDetected) {
    DEBUG((DEBUG_ERROR, "COMPROMISE DETECTED - INITIATING RECOVERY!"));
    
    // 🔥 Phoenix rises from the ashes
    Status = PhoenixGuardExecuteRecovery(CompromiseType, SecurityLevel);
    
    if (!EFI_ERROR(Status)) {
        // 🎉 System recovered and rebooting clean
        gRT->ResetSystem(EfiResetCold, EFI_SUCCESS, 0, NULL);
    } else {
        // 🛡️ Fall back to clean OS boot
        PhoenixGuardCleanOsBoot();
    }
}
```

### Benefits Over Traditional Approach

| Aspect | Traditional Halt | PhoenixGuard Recovery |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Availability** | ❌ System down until manual intervention | ✅ System automatically recovers |
| **Response Time** | ❌ Hours/days for manual recovery | ✅ Minutes for automatic recovery |
| **Expertise Required** | ❌ Skilled technician needed | ✅ Fully automated |
| **Attack Persistence** | ❌ Malware may survive manual recovery | ✅ Clean firmware/OS breaks persistence |
| **Business Impact** | ❌ Significant downtime costs | ✅ Minimal business disruption |
| **Scalability** | ❌ Doesn't scale to many systems | ✅ Scales to enterprise deployments |

## Philosophy in Action

### Real-World Example

**Traditional Security Mindset:**
> "We must prevent all attacks. If we detect compromise, halt the system to prevent further damage."

**PhoenixGuard Mindset:**
> "We assume attacks will succeed. When they do, we automatically recover and continue operations with minimal disruption."

### The Phoenix Metaphor

Just as the mythical phoenix burns to ashes and then rises renewed and purified, PhoenixGuard allows systems to be "burned" by malware attacks and then automatically rise again, clean and restored.

The beauty is that each "rebirth" cycle breaks the attack persistence chain - even the most sophisticated malware cannot survive if the system keeps booting from clean sources.
