✅ Nuclear Boot ISO deployed to ESP successfully!
💿 Virtual CD location: /boot/efi/recovery/PhoenixGuard-Nuclear-Recovery.iso
🔒 ISO format provides read-only protection against modification
🎯 Size: 260M

🚀 To use: Reboot and select 'PhoenixGuard Nuclear Boot Recovery (Virtual CD)' from GRUB menu
📋 Alternative: Run 'make boot-from-esp-iso' to boot immediately
GRUB entry added successfully
🔐 LEVEL 3: Double-kexec secure firmware access (dry-run)
Level 3 script available - skipping dangerous kexec operation for safety
🚀 REAL HARDWARE TESTING: make phoenix
📊 Creating fake CRITICAL risk scenario to test full escalation
🚨 TESTING CRITICAL RISK ESCALATION:
⚠️  Note: Some operations require root privileges.
   PhoenixGuard will prompt for sudo when needed.

🔥 PHOENIXGUARD - Progressive Bootkit Defense & Recovery
========================================================
🎯 Intelligent escalation from safest to most extreme recovery methods

🎯 PhoenixGuard will try each recovery method in order of safety:
   Each level requires your confirmation before proceeding.
   You can stop at any level or let it escalate to success.


============================================================
🔍 DETECT LEVEL 1: SOFTWARE SCANNING (SAFEST)
============================================================
🔍 LEVEL 1: DETECT - Software-based bootkit scanning
==================================================
This performs comprehensive bootkit detection with zero system changes.
✅ Safe: No modifications to system
✅ Fast: Usually completes in under 2 minutes
✅ Comprehensive: Scans firmware, NVRAM, bootloaders

🎯 Proceed to scan for bootkit infections? [y/N]: 🔧 Running bootkit detection scan

📊 Scan Results: Risk Level = CLEAN
✅ System appears clean! No further escalation needed.
🎯 Recommendation: Continue normal operations with periodic scans.

✅ Level 1 completed successfully!
🎯 PhoenixGuard recovery workflow complete.

📋 Recommended next steps:
  1. Verify system integrity with additional scans
  2. Monitor system behavior for anomalies
  3. Consider upgrading to hardware-based protection
