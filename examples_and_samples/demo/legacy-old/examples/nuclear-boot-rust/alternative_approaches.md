# Alternative Bootloader Approaches for Nuclear Boot

## Current Issue
The Rust `bootloader` crate has a page allocation conflict:
```
PageAlreadyMapped(PhysFrame[4KiB](0x401000))
```

## Alternatives

### 1. Limine Bootloader (Rust Compatible)
```toml
[dependencies]
limine = "0.1"
```
- More mature, used in production
- Better memory management
- UEFI and BIOS support

### 2. Minimal C Bootstrap + Rust
Create a tiny C bootloader that just:
- Sets up basic environment
- Maps memory safely  
- Jumps to Rust main()

### 3. GRUB + Multiboot
Use GRUB with multiboot protocol:
- Rock solid, battle-tested
- Let GRUB handle the tricky memory setup
- Jump straight to Rust kernel

### 4. Direct QEMU Kernel Loading
Skip bootloader entirely:
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel nuclear-boot.elf
```

### 5. Custom Assembly Bootstrap
Write minimal assembly that:
- Sets up protected mode
- Maps essential memory
- Calls Rust entry point

## Recommendation
For a production bootkit defense system, I'd go with **Limine** or **C bootstrap** for maximum compatibility and reliability.
