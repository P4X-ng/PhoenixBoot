# PhoenixGuard legacy archive

This directory contains prototypes, experiments, and superseded assets preserved for reference. Nothing here is used by the current demo/build flow.

Structure:
- examples/: old source trees and prototypes (Rust boot, multi-component EDK2 app, misc sources)
- scripts/: older demo/build scripts
- docs/: design notes and older documentation
- tools/: hooks and Makefiles not used anymore

Restoring something:
- Move the file(s) back to the project root or appropriate folder.
- Re-run the build or demo.

If you need any item resurrected into the main flow, ping the maintainer (you!).
